        <h1 class="about-title">The Story Behind The Barber Hub</h1>
        <p class="about-intro">
            My name is Angela, and my journey into barbering has been anything but traditional. 
            For over 20 years, I worked in the hair industry, specializing in women’s and men’s cuts. 
            I loved the craft, the precision, and the ability to create something uniquely suited to each person. 
            But for me, barbering was never just about cutting hair—it was about connection.

            <h2>Why The Barber Hub?</h2>
            <p>
                Over the years, I saw a gap in the industry—barbers needed a better way to 
                track their clients, showcase their work, and manage their services. The Barber Hub 
                was born from that need. I wanted a place where professionals could streamline their 
                business while keeping their craft at the center.
            </p>

            <h2>From Barbering to Tech</h2>
            <p>
                My journey took an unexpected turn when I decided to dive into software development. 
                I saw firsthand how technology could bridge gaps, solve real problems, and create opportunities. 
                So I jumped in, learning everything I could, and built The Barber Hub as a way to bring my two 
                worlds together—barbering and tech.
